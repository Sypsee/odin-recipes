    <h3>Ingredients :-</h3>

    <li>Ramen noodles (our classic Maruchan package is all we need, sans the seasoning!)</li>
    <li>Garlic and ginger</li>
    <li>Broth (chicken or veg)</li>
    <li>Dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
    <li>Veggies like carrots or kale</li>
    <li>All your favorite toppings like some panko, egg, chili oil, etc.</li>

    <h3>Steps To make your ramen!</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Stir-Fry Aromatics:</b> Garlic and ginger, what a delicious duo. This is where the flavor is, friends.</li>
        <li><b>Make Your (Easy!) Broth:</b> Add some chicken broth and dried shiitake mushrooms for some umami punch.</li>
        <li><b>Add Noodles:</b> Cook your noodles right in the broth with some scallions (more flavor, please!).</li>
        <li><b>Add Veg:</b> Thinly sliced kale, shredded carrots, whatever you'd like! Cook until just tender.</li>
        <li><b>Top It Off:</b> Add some crunchy panko crumbs, a soft-boiled egg, chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce, whatever your heart desires.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>
        Simmering some garlic, ginger, and dried mushrooms with your chicken broth<br />
        makes for a great quickie ‚Äústock‚Äù. A good while in the pot will get some nice flavors<br />
        going that will soon be soaked up by those noodles. And by good while, I mean 19 minutes,<br />
        because the whole thing takes 20. The soft egg on top will get you all the<br />
        Instagram likes, and the panko and extra chili oil or Sriracha will light your mouth<br />
        up with joy.
    </h4>

    <b>
        At the end of the day, a deep bowl of bright veggies <br />
        + flavorful broth + golden panko crumbs + soft-boiled egg + chewy,<br />
        tangled noodles is not going to let you down. ‚ô°
